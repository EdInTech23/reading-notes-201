Importance of Virtualization in the Amazon EC2 Cloud
### How has virtualization evolved beyond desktops and servers?

Virtualization extended from desktops and servers to also cover the network, storage, data devices, as well applications.


### In the context of the Amazon IaaS Cloud Service Model, what does EC2 stand for?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud


### What types of storage does EC2 use, and how is EC2 web traffic managed?

EC2 instances use the storage through either Ephemeral (temporary) or Elastic Block Storage snapshots stored in Amazon S3


### What are the benefits of service-oriented architecture for customers of EC2 virtualized services?

CloudWatch monitors AWS cloud resources and how EC2 web traffic is load balanced as well as how it passes through various security rules.


### Analyze how cloud virtualization can promote equitable access to technology resources across diverse populations. How can this technology bridge cultural gaps and empower underserved communities?

Since everything is connected via Amazon's servers anyone can access them. So you can be in Seattle working on VM but if you are working with someone in India they also could log on and hop on the same servers. This makes different cultures come together. Someone in India could have a whole other way of doing something then someone in the US making us learn more and how to do the same thing but might be in a more efficient way.
