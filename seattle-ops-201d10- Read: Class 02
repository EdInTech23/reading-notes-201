## Reading
### What is Bash?

### What is the primary function of a shell in a computer’s operating system?
Shells provide a way for you to communicate with the operating system
### How does Bash locate and execute commands on a Linux or Unix system?
Bash can look up commands. When you issue a command to Bash, it searches specific directories on your system to see whether such a command exists. If the command does exist, then Bash executes it.
### How can you determine if your system is running a Bash shell?
To find out whether you're running a Bash shell, you can use the echo command along with a special variable representing the name of the currently running process:

$ echo $0

bash
### What makes Bash scripting powerful and why is it considered scriptable?
bash is considered so powerful is because it's scriptable. Anything you can type into Bash manually, you can also list in a plain-text file and have Bash run it for you. Instead of spending an afternoon manually running a hundred commands, you can script the commands and have your computer execute them while you tend to more important matters.
### Bash scripting allows for customization, automation, and efficiency. Discuss methods or practices from your previous work experience or cultural background that aim to achieve similar goals in daily tasks.
