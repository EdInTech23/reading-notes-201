## Notes for 10/23/2023


### Lab  1
## Backup Types  
### Normal/Full
everything
good to do when its your first time doing a backup 
High backup time/ low restore time

### Incremental
All file changed since last incremental backup

Low backup time "less files to update"/High restore time "needs to gather rest of resources"

Differentail
All files changed since the last full backup 

Modertate backup time/ Moderate restore time.

## Offsite Backups 
Hot Site:

Ready to take over for the failed production site immediately

the most expensive option

Backups of data stoed in a different geographic location than the production system.

it in a diffrent phisical location 

## Cold Site
Take a long time to spin up

less costly than hot site 
have some of the hardware you need but 

might need some more components 

## Warm site

Takes some time to spin up but not as long as a cold site 

Middling costs to maintain

## Systems Redundancy
### High availability
Achieved when redundancy is implemented in case the first server goes down

High availability is no substitute for a good backup strategy 

 system redundancy used in conjuction with a back up strategy not to replace it 

 ## Fail Over

 occurs when the primary server fails over to the backup server 

 ## Cluster

 A set of servers that work together to deliver the same 

 ## Comprehensive vs. Specific backups
## More Comprehensive
 ### Bare Metal Backup;
 Complete backup of an entire system, including the operating system applications settings and data

 ### Image-based Backup
 Creating a complete image or copy of a specific system or disk at a specific point in time

 VM Snapshot an image capturing a virtual machines current disk and memory state
 ## More Specific

 ### System restore point;
 Snapshot of the systems configuration and settings, created by the operation system 

 ### file back ups 

 Coping individual files and folders, usually selected by the user, to a separate storage location

## Virtual machine Snapshots
A snapshot saves the vm in an exact state;
All OS and user data on the virtual disk

All VM "hardware" configuration, such as network
